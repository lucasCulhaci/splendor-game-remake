# Splendor - Software Development Project I (2022-2023)
  
## What is **"Splendor"**?

Splendor is a card game for 2 to 4 players.

During the game you collect gemstone tokens that you can use to buy development cards. With these cards you can earn points, but they also guarantee a bonus. With this bonus you can get the next development cards you want to buy cheaper again. Meanwhile, you try to make combinations of the development cards that will allow you to attract noblemen to you. This will score you extra points.

Once someone has reached 15 points, everyone can finish their turn. When everyone has had an equal number of turns, the player with the most points wins.
