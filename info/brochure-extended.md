## **IMPORTANT**
Do not save anything locally on your PC. Ensure that everything is accessible online at all times!

The latest code is on GitHub, the latest analysis + design can be found on VP online, and share other documents via OneDrive for all team members and the accompanying lecturer.

# Assignment

## What is Splendor?

Splendor is a card game for 2 to 4 players. During the game, you collect gemstone tokens that you can use to buy development cards. With these cards, you can earn points, but they also guarantee a bonus. With this bonus, you can get the next development cards you want to buy at a lower cost. Meanwhile, you try to create combinations of development cards to attract nobles to you. This earns you extra points. Once someone has reached 15 points, each player gets one more turn. When everyone has had an equal number of turns, the player with the most points wins.

## How to Approach the Project?

The assignment of the game was outlined in a number of use cases. The use cases are the contract with your customer, describing exactly how everything should work. So, don't start programming randomly. Follow exactly what is described in the use case. Go through all phases of an iteration (analysis, design, testing, implementation). Once one iteration is completed, you can start the next one.

1. UC1 - Create a new game
2. UC2 - Play the game
3. UC3 - Play a round
4. UC4 - Play a turn

Create per use case (contains all required functionality).

[> OPEN FULL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT](#productontwikkeling)

# Point Distribution

70% > Product + Product Development  
30% > Process (teamwork, attitudes)

## Product (final result)

### Criterion 1: Completeness of product in terms of form

### Criterion 2: Completeness of product in terms of functionality

All functionalities are described in the use cases.

### Criterion 3: Completeness of product in terms of non-functional requirements

* user interface (console / graphical)
* **multilingual application**

## Product Development

### Criterion 1: Analyzing

**Apply rules from Software Analysis!**

* activity diagram
* domain model
* SSD, accompanying OCs

### Criterion 2: Designing

**Apply rules from OOSD I and the established analysis!**

Prepare the DCD:
* DCD aligns with SSDs
* DCD contains what was described in OC

### Criterion 3: Testing

Every "pure" domain class, i.e., NOT DomainController and repository classes, is adequately tested through JUNIT tests.

### Criterion 4: Programming

**Apply rules from OOSD I, OOSD II, and the established design!**

* adhere to OO principles
* adhere to the 3 layers
* document correctly throughout the entire process
* robust application
* find the correct methods from the DCD in the code

### Criterion 5: Database

**Apply rules from Databases!**

* conceptual ERD model
* corresponding relational model
* script with DDL instructions for implementation in a relational database (MySQL)

You must be able to read & write data!

# Process

## Criterion 1: Registration

Complete the logbook and follow-up form.

## Criterion 2: Planning

Create a weekly plan, work according to that plan, and check if you are on schedule.

## Criterion 3: Teamwork

Collaborate effectively and encourage teamwork.

## Criterion 4: Preparation for Weekly Contact Moment

Preparation means:
- Presenting and being aware of the work from the past week
- Listing and bringing questions

## Criterion 5: Dealing with Feedback / Following Advice

This includes both substantive and procedural feedback.

## Criterion 6: Punctuality

Be punctual for every appointment (online or at school).

> Each criterion is described at 5 levels (see extras). Twice (midway through the semester and at the end), you will have to determine for yourself at which level you are for each criterion and also indicate that. Self-awareness is an important link in successful teamwork.

# Final Products

At the end of the project, you will submit a well-prepared dossier containing:
- Cover page (see Chamilo)
- ERD, relational model, script with DDL instructions (per use case if applicable)
- Analysis and design (domain model, activity diagram, SSD, OC, and DCD) per use case (or scenario if applicable);
- 1 A4 page of text per group member with your experiences regarding group work: what have you learned, what were the difficulties, what are your strengths, ...

Submit your project via the Chamilo assignments module:  
Create 1 zip file with:

- Well-prepared dossier
- Eclipse project with the Java code
- The generated Java documentation of the code (Javadoc)
- The complete analysis and design (vpp file from Visual Paradigm)
- Script with DDL instructions of the MySQL database
- Export file of the MySQL database (all data)

**Submit this completed dossier via the assignments module in Chamilo before Monday, May 15, 23:59**

## Recording

**Via Teams (recording of a meeting with the entire team), create a video demonstrating your final result.**  
The final result is an application with a graphical user interface showcasing all requested functionalities.  
This video is also a group effort, with each team member speaking.  
This video is available via Teams no later than Monday, May 15, 23:59.  
This video is not edited; nothing needs to be cut. It is the recording of a live demo.

## Digital Dossier

During the semester, you also build a digital dossier. Each group gets its own documents folder on OneDrive. This folder is only accessible to group members and all accompanying lecturers.

## Logbook

Whenever a group member works on the project, they note the details of the work (description and time registration) in the logbook.

The follow-up form is also included here.
